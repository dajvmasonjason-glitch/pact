# [PACT: Preserving Anchored Cores in Task-vectors for Model Merging](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2606.18627)

![PACT Overview](08c18153b3772650c90df4f35130f1d1.jpg)

**PACT** (Preserving Anchored Cores in Task-vectors) addresses a fundamental issue in model merging: task-critical knowledge often remains embedded in pre-trained weights rather than being fully transferred into task vectors. We term these **Load-Bearing Wall (LBW) dimensions**. By ignoring LBW dimensions, existing task-vector-based approaches fail to fully resolve task conflicts and may inadvertently damage task-specific knowledge. PACT preserves these anchored cores by aligning their orthogonal complements with the subspace of pre-trained weights, then removing the aligned components from task vectors before merging. PACT can be seamlessly integrated with existing model merging methods (Task Arithmetic, TIES, DARE-TIES, Iso-C, etc.) and consistently improves performance, establishing new state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks.
